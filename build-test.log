npm WARN cli npm v9.6.2 does not support Node.js v16.0.0. You should probably upgrade to a
npm WARN cli newer version of node as we can't make any promises that npm will work with this
npm WARN cli version. This version of npm supports the following node versions: `^14.17.0 ||
npm WARN cli ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0`. You can find the latest version at https://nodejs.org/.
